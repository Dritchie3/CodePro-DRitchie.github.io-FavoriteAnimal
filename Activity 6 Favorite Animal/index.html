        <P>Australian Shepherds are originally a bred for herding.  As such, they like to be busy and they are a member of a "herding" group.  Also, they like to take part of whatever their master is doing.  The more you learn about this br3eed of dog, the more you might decide this is the right dog for you to own.
        </P>
        
        <p>The Australlian Shepherd, or "Aussies" as they are often refered to, need to be busy in order to stay happy.  They love games like flyball and they like activities like herding trials, agility training, tracking and obedience school.  They are very happy when you take them for jogs, just make sure your dog is in good health before putting them into a potentially bad situation.</p>
        
        <p>Aussies are bred specifically for things such as herding, performance events. The herding dogs tend to be smaller and thinner than show dogs and have shorter coats. Those traits can make them more agile as they move stock, and the shorter coat is less likely to snag on brush.</p>
        
        <p>They also make great watchdogs if that is what you are looking for.  They tend to be weary of strangers and if they see anything unusual, they will alert you with a bark.  Our dogs are very good at following our lead of friendliness why first meeting a stranger. They are not always friendly when meeting a stranger.  So we always watch to make sure they are good before leaving them with a stranger.</p>
        
        <p>To sum up, the Australian Shepherd is a fun, hard-working, talented dog that most dog lovers would be happy to have as a pet.</p>
